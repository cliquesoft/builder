overview:	A convenient, practical package builder for Linux distros that
		enables a user to compile and/or package software quickly and
		effortlessly. Designed to be as comprehensive as possible, this
		project can automatically process compilation dependencies,
		obtain source code (from a variety of locations), apply desired
		patches, compile (for a variety of CPU architectures), install
		(along with any additional files), and finally build distro
		package(s).
comments:	This project is suitable for end users, developers, and package
		maintainers. Any users wishing to build from scratch can easily
		do so with a short, simple command. Developers are free to use
		any supported compiling framework to generate a generic profile
		for package maintainers to modify specifically for their Linux
		distro. Once a projects' source code has been made publically
		available, all that's required is the profile and anyone can
		utilize the software. No complicated prerequisites to manage,
		no lengthy manuals to read through - just a simple, single,
		short command!
		  [PLANNED UPDATES]
		There are several planned updates that will eventually be
		added. Patches or donations are welcome and will expedite
		future updates. Features include:
		- Added output options: 'json', 'html', 'xml'
		- A DIRECTORY parameter for flexibility
		- A graphical interface
		- Automated package checking/downloading/updating
		- Ability to process .deb (and other) package types
		Feature requests can be sent to: service@cliquesoft.org
