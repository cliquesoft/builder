Comments:       A convenient, practical package builder for Linux distros that
                enables a user to compile and/or package software quickly and
                effortlessly. Designed to be as comprehensive as possible, this
                project can automatically process compilation dependencies,
                obtain source code (from a variety of locations), apply desired
                patches, compile (for a variety of CPU architectures), install
                (along with any additional files), and finally build distro
                package(s).
                ----
                This project is suitable for end users, developers, and package
                maintainers. Any users wishing to build from scratch can easily
                do so with a short, simple command. Developers are free to use
                any supported compiling framework to generate a generic profile
                for package maintainers to modify specifically for their Linux
                distro. Once a projects' source code has been made publically
                available, all that's required is the profile and anyone can
                utilize the software. No complicated prerequisites to manage,
                no lengthy manuals to read through - just a simple, single,
		short command!
