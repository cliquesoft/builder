Building with builder

	There are several ways to obtain the source code for software that you
	would like to build, if you did not download it manually. Each is listed
	below along with its related variable location:

	1. local directory   '-C dir'   DIR_REPO @ /etc/builder/builder.conf
	2. from developer    '-C dev'   URL_CODE @ package config[.1] file
	3. distro repo       '-C repo'  URL_REPO @ /etc/builder/builder.conf
	4. info file         '-C info'  URL_INFO @ /etc/builder/builder.conf

	These would allow a user to download and compile software by issuing a
	command such as:

	builder -c -C repo ifplugd

	To perform the same steps, but to additionally package the software for
	a distro, don't pass the '-c':

	builder -C repo ifplugd

	Using any of the above methods, your present directory is irrelevent.
	However, if you downloaded the source code manually, you need to be
	inside its directory before issuing any commands. Likewise, you will
	need to download its builder profile from either the developer or your
	Linux distro repository, and install it beforehand:

	1. Download the builder profile
	2. builder -i NAME

	It is also possible to build multiple related softwares using a single
	builder profile. Take for example, the alsa project. It has two source
	codes - alsa-lib and alsa-utils. You would need to configure an 'alsa'
	builder profile using a multi-pass setup so that the first pass compiles
	alsa-lib (with config.1 > CODE='alsa-lib') and the second pass compiles
	alsa-utils (with config.2 > CODE='alsa-utils'). In this instance, you
	would also need to be one level up in the directory structure:

	# ls
	alsa-lib-1.1.4.1/   alsa-utils-1.1.4/
	# builder alsa


Order of operations

	Below we will list the order of operations that the builder script runs
	when compiling and optionally packaging software:

	1. Process passed switches
	2. Adjust variable values via /etc/builder and ~/.etc/builder configs
	3. System checks to make sure everything exists and is writable
	4. Install compile-time dependencies
	5. Optionally obtain the source code
	6. Apply any patches to source code		pwd=source code
	7. Execute pre.compile script			pwd=source code
	8. Compile process (configure)			pwd=source code
	9. Execute post.configure script		pwd=source code
	10. Compile process (make, ..., make install)	pwd=source code
	11. Copy in the 'extra' files			pwd=source code
	12. Execute post.compile script			pwd=source code
	13. Separate contents into individual packages	pwd=DIR_DUMP/NAME[.TYPE]
		NOTE: can be skipped if SKIP=TRUE
	14. Apply file/directory ownership/permissions	pwd=DIR_DUMP/NAME[.TYPE]
		NOTE: will only be executed on the last pass
	15. Execute pre.package script			pwd=DIR_DUMP
		NOTE: apply any final file/directory ownerships/permissions now
	16. Create the various packages			pwd=DIR_DUMP
	17. Copy the files into the local repo		pwd=DIR_DUMP
	18. Execute post.package script			pwd=DIR_DUMP
	19. Cleanup					pwd=DIR_DUMP
	20a. Initiate the next pass if requested
	20b. Execute cleanup script as final command	pwd=DIR_DUMP


Example directory structure

	/etc/builder/ config					# global config file that personalizes the global variables set of top of script
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/config[.1,.2,...]		# individual package files with specifics if the general compile options don't fit (see below)	NOTE: this is run while in the DIR_DUMP/NAME directory
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/cleanup				# a script that will be executed to further clean up the file system
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/params				# instead of passing the parameters on the command line, this file can be used instead
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/pre.compile[.1,.2,...]		# a pre-compile script that can get run to perform any neccessary specific adjustments		NOTE: this is run while in the source code directory
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/post.compile[.1,.2,...]		# same as above, but run post-compile								NOTE: this is run while in the source code directory
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/pre.package[.1,.2,...]		# a pre-package script that can get run to perform any neccessary specific adjustments		NOTE: this is run while in the DIR_DUMP directory
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/post.package[.1,.2,...]		# same as above, but run post-package								NOTE: this is run while in the DIR_DUMP directory
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/proper[.1,.2,...]		# a flag (empty file) that indicates cleanup should occur automatically without prompt for each compiled package
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/extras/ usr/local/tce.installed/foo	# stores any files that are not part of 'include' (e.g. httpd.conf for php compile); useful when DIRS=TRUE
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/include[.1,.2,...]/ [VAR]/foo.conf	# contains things like .desktop files, icons, install markers/scripts, service scripts, etc	NOTE: you can put things under directories like 'DIR_BIN/foo' to get copied into the directory tree associated with the DIR_BIN value (e.g. DIR_BIN='${DIR_INST}/bin' > /usr/local/bin/foo)
	/var/cache/builder/ foo/patches[.1,.2,...]/ xyz_patch.cpp	# contains any distro specific patches to be applied pre-compile
	/tmp/builder/						# the temporary location to store any information and files needed by this script
	/tmp/staging/						# the staging location that stores the compiled software where it gets split and packaged
	/tmp/repo/						# contains all the packaged software to be moved into an online repo


Example foo/config		  NOTE: these are comprehensive or complementary

	# Toggle the execution for any of these commands
	# NOTE: when using multi-pass files (e.g. config.1, config.2), these can
	#       be used to define which pass any of these commands are executed
	#       depending on the value assigned in each config file
	CHECK=1		# make check
	CLEAN=0		# make clean; NOTE: a '2' value = 'make distclean'
	CONF=1		# ./configure
	PROP=0		# make mrproper
	TEST=1		# make test
	SORT=''		# indicates the package contents need sorting

	# The URL to the developers source code used with this builder profile
	# NOTES:
	#     - if doing multi-pass, this needs to be in the first config file
	#     - this is optional but does allow a '-C dev' call
	URL_CODE=''

	# The below variable is optional and should only be used when compiling
	# more than one software with a single builder profile. For example you
	# can compile both alsa-libs and alsa-utils with a single 'builder alsa'
	# command if the config.1 CODE value is 'alsa-libs' and config.2 CODE
	# value is 'alsa-utils'. This value would uniquely identify which source
	# code directory to use per pass.
